=============
Design Assets
=============

Design assets you deliver to Mozilla as a consultant should be provided 
in an agreed format and should be ready for a developer to turn into 
production ready code.

Things to consider include:

* The ideal design mockup should be an HTML prototype that can be viewed 
  and resized in a web browser.
* If an HTML prototype is not provided, either a Sketch of Photoshop 
  static mockup is acceptable.
* If a static mockup is provided, both a desktop and mobile representation 
  of a page should be included.
* If image assets intersect with the edge of an artboard in a static 
  mockup, make sure to include those assets uncropped in the document, 
  so a developer can export and use them in context of a responsive web 
  page that can be larger than the fixed sized artboard.
* Image assets should be included in an appropriate format. We prefer 
  SVG whenever possible, but if an image includes many paths or gradients 
  then sometimes a PNG or JPG makes more sense. If non-vector images are 
  provided, high resolution versions should be included.
